# This file has been replaced with separate docker-compose files for each project:
# - vc-service/docker-compose.yml (for API and database)
# - vc-client/sa-client/docker-compose.yml (for web frontend)
# Use the individual files to run services independently in different environments
#
# To run API service: cd vc-service && docker compose up
# To run web client: cd vc-client/sa-client && docker compose up
