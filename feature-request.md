## Adding transaction

    Add flag to mark transaction as 'Update account balance'. This kind of transaction will define account balance as the value entered in the form, and generate 'fake' transaction record to fill gap between last balance and new one. This feature will be used in case when we do not really know what happend with our money, where did we sent it (like cash spendings).
